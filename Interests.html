        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <h3><u>Globe- The ground of Chess</u> </h3>
        <p>My heart constantly beats for geopolitics. I have a deep interest in geopolitics and I always try to be updated with the latest advancements. Geopolitics is such a dynamic field that one can never be bored with it. With the current pace of change in geopolitics, Our Country is definitely the ray of hope in the horizon of future. I am very proud and excited to see the progress of our nation in the future. </p>
        <h3><u>The Ultimate Cosmos:-</u> </h3>
        <p>The space is full of marvels and mysteries. Somehow for me it gives a way for my imagination to think beyond our small world and to look at the vastness of Universe. My brain seems to get freezed when I try to imagine the unimaginable. Definitely ready for a cup to tea and chit chat regarding universe!!</p>
        <h3><u>Sanskrit, Mantras and Culture:- </u></h3>
        <p>It's always a blessing to learn more about the Mother of all languages, <b>The Sanskrit</b>. As a person who carries excessive pride in her culture;  I am always desperate to learn more about sanskrit and ancient indian mantras. Currently I am finding my way to conjoin my passion and profession via researching in the field of finding a relationship between modern day Computer Science and one of the oldest langugage ever known to human civilization.  </p>
