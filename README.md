# Prajakta Joshi's Portfolio

## About
Hello there! I hope today is going well for you. Welcome to my portfolio, where you may get a peek at the fascinating experiences and activities that are forming me as an engineer and a person.

At the Vishwakarma Institute of Information Technology (VIIT), I, Prajakta Joshi, am presently pursuing a BTech in Information Technology. I'm excited to expand my knowledge and abilities in my subject of study and my hobbies as a second-year student.

One of the principles which I always keep in mind is 'attempt'. I am attempting various things along with my academics which are aligned with my interests. JAVA is my first language and I am constantly trying to be better at it. After all its the essence of my life..."Today I must be better than yesterday".

## Interests
### Globe - The Ground of Chess
My heart constantly beats for geopolitics. I have a deep interest in geopolitics and I always try to be updated with the latest advancements. Geopolitics is such a dynamic field that one can never be bored with it. With the current pace of change in geopolitics, Our Country is definitely the ray of hope in the horizon of the future. I am very proud and excited to see the progress of our nation in the future.

### The Ultimate Cosmos
The space is full of marvels and mysteries. Somehow for me, it gives a way for my imagination to think beyond our small world and to look at the vastness of the Universe. My brain seems to get frozen when I try to imagine the unimaginable. Definitely ready for a cup of tea and a chit-chat regarding the universe!

### Sanskrit, Mantras, and Culture
It's always a blessing to learn more about the Mother of all languages, The Sanskrit. As a person who carries excessive pride in her culture; I am always desperate to learn more about Sanskrit and ancient Indian mantras. Currently, I am finding my way to conjoin my passion and profession by researching the relationship between modern-day Computer Science and one of the oldest languages ever known to human civilization.
