            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Hello there! I hope today is going well for you. Welcome to my portfolio, where you may get a peek at the fascinating experiences and activities that are forming me as an engineer and a person.
                </p> 
                <p>At the Vishwakarma Institute of Information Technology (VIIT), I, Prajakta Joshi, am presently pursuing a BTech in Information Technology. I'm excited to expand my knowledge and abilities in my subject of study and my hobbies as a second-year student.</p>
                <p> One of the principles which I always keep in mind is 'attempt'. I am attempting various things along with my academics which are aligned with my interests. JAVA is my first language and I am constantly trying to be better at it. After all its the essensnce of my life..."Today I must be better than yesterday". </p>
